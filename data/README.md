# Sample FB Ads Dataset

This folder contains a **small sample dataset (`sample_ads.csv`)** used for:
- fast testing
- reproducibility
- demonstration without needing full dataset

### Columns include:
campaign_name, adset_name, date, spend, impressions, clicks, ctr, purchases,
revenue, roas, creative_type, creative_message, audience_type, platform, country

### To use your full dataset:
1. Replace sample_ads.csv with your real CSV, OR
2. Change `paths.data_path` in `config/config.yaml` to point to your real file.
